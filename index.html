            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal tech journey page! My name is Saviour Eking, and I am thrilled to share my
                aspirations and goals for the next two years in the tech field. This journey is not just about acquiring
                new skills but about transforming my passion for technology into a meaningful and impactful career.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Spark</h2>
            <p>It all started with a simple curiosity about how websites and applications work. I remember the first
                time I wrote a line of HTML and saw it come to life in a browser. That small achievement sparked a fire
                in me, driving me to explore deeper into the realms of programming and development. Over the years, this
                curiosity has grown into a full-fledged passion.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Goals for the Next Two Years</h2>
            <p>As I embark on this journey, I have set several goals to guide my progress and keep me motivated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Work on my socials and branding:</strong> Building a strong online presence and personal
                    brand is crucial in today's tech landscape. I plan to actively engage on platforms like LinkedIn,
                    Twitter, and GitHub, sharing my projects, insights, and learning experiences. Additionally, I'll
                    develop a consistent personal brand that reflects my professional values and skills, creating a
                    portfolio website to showcase my work and achievements.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn and Master React:</strong> React is a powerful library that has revolutionized
                    front-end development. Over the next year, I aim to master React, understanding its core principles,
                    best practices, and advanced concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Build and Deploy Full-Stack Applications:</strong> Building complete applications from
                    scratch is a goal I am excited about. I plan to create at least three full-stack projects,
                    incorporating various technologies and deploying them for real-world use.</li>
                <li><strong>Contribute to Open-Source Projects:</strong> The open-source community is an incredible
                    place to learn and grow. I aim to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborating with other
                    developers and giving back to the community that has given me so much.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure a Front-End Developer Position:</strong> My ultimate goal is to secure a position as
                    a front-end developer at a forward-thinking company. I am committed to honing my skills and building
                    a portfolio that showcases my capabilities and passion.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Algorithms and data structures are the backbone of
                    efficient programming. I will dedicate time to practicing these concepts, improving my
                    problem-solving skills, and preparing for technical interviews.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <p>To achieve these goals, I have laid out a timeline to keep myself on track and measure my progress:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Q3 2024:</strong> Complete an advanced React course, building a solid foundation in modern
                    front-end development.</li>
                <li><strong>Q4 2024:</strong> Build and launch a personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects and
                    skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Q1 2025:</strong> Contribute to at least two open-source projects, gaining experience and
                    expanding my network.</li>
                <li><strong>Q2 2025:</strong> Apply for (front-end, back-end, full-stack) developer positions,
                    leveraging my portfolio and
                    open-source contributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Q3 2025 upwards:</strong> Continue learning, building projects, and growing professionally
                    in
                    the tech
                    field.</li>
            </ul>
